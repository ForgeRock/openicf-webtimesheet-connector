# webtimesheet-connector

An OpenICF connector built to work with the [ForgeRock Identity Management Provisioning System]
(https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-management/identity-provisioning). This connector allows the ForgeRock 
Identity Platform to provision users to Web Timesheet.

## Compatability
Works with [OpenICF 1.5](https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/openicf/1.5/release-notes/index.html). Please read the release notes for more information on compatability with Java Connector Servers and version of OpenIDM/IDM.

**Note** This connector was last updated to use the Repliconnect API in 2013. It is likely to require work to get it to work with the current API.
